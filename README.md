GTK Icon
========

Very simple program which makes tray icon. The icon will run script if you click on it. You can change image run time using command: dbus-send --dest=com.funcoil.gtkicon / com.funcoil.gtkicon.changeIcon :'PUT/YOUR/PATH/HERE' Usage of changeScript and quit commands is similar.

Intent of this project is to allow (shell) scripts showing status icon on panel easily. Please keep that in mind if you propose changes.
